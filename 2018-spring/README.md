> Lit Hum, as it is commonly known, is designed to enhance students’
understanding of main lines of literary and philosophical development that
have shaped western thought for nearly three millennia. Much more than a
survey of great books, Lit Hum encourages students to become critical readers
of the literary past we have inherited. Although most of our Lit Hum works
(and the cultures they represent) are remote from us, we nonetheless learn
something about ourselves in struggling to appreciate and understand them. Why
did these works cause previous generations to value them so highly? In what
ways are our authors in conversation with each other? How are these books
relevant to our lives? In the end, what do we gain from them? These questions
offer just a sample of the kinds of provocation that Lit Hum is meant to
arouse. Students should not expect Lit Hum to teach them what these texts are
about. Rather, it asks students to join a small group of classmates to raise
questions and debate answers. Lit Hum seminars should fascinate, delight, and
confound. Our hope is that students will return to these books, their beauty,
and the profound questions they raise over the course of their lives.

## Assessment

The class depends on an engaged readership. To this end, students are expected
read regularly, discuss the texts in class and online, complete a single "core
context" assignment along with a final exam.

* 25% [Core Context](#core-context)
* 25% [Class Participation](#class-participation)
* 25% Midterm Exam
* 25% [Final Exam](#final-exam)

### Core Context

Every class, one student will deliver a short-presentation (~10 mins) on the
Text/Author we are reading. The presentation will highlight their biography,
their intellectual concerns and contributions, and some recent assessment of
their thought in scholarly literature (JSTOR searches limited to past 5
years). This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the class begins.

Another student will deliver a short-presentation (~10 mins) on the context
for the Text/Author we are reading. This context will comprise of at least ten
(10) headlines selected from newspapers contemporary to the Text/Author. To
assemble these headlines, you will visit the Subject Specialists at Butler
Library
<http://library.columbia.edu/about/policies/collection-development/liaisons.html>,
who can assist you in identifying the appropriate digitized archives of
contemporary newspapers. This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the
class begins.

### Class Participation

To get the full points, you will attend every single class, and be an active
listener to your colleagues, and sometimes, a commenter and facilitator for
their ideas and sometimes, a speaker of your own thoughts.

We expect our discussions--online and in-person--to answer to the ideals
embodied in our texts. We aim for a critical discussion, one that at the same
time preserves the multiplicity of voices present in the classroom. Listen as
much as you speak, be respectful of dissenting voices, enter into a dialogue
rather than a soliloquy, show empathy, respond, and encourage others to speak.

### Final Exam

The final exam will consist of ~30 passage IDs. It is designed as an objective
metric that rewards regular engagement with the material.

## Policies

Attendance and participation is required. Class participation requires your
active participation. Some basic rules: come to class on time, do not disrupt
the class, put your phones on silent, turn off all computing devices. As a
discussion seminar, this course survives only if you come to every class, and
participate by doing the readings, listening and commenting in class, turning
in the assignment and seeing me during my office hours. Discussion means
attentive and respectful listening, short and timely speaking, and creating a
cordial and warm atmosphere wherein all are invited to test their ideas and
impressions. Please read everything before class. Take notes in the margins of
the text; underline key sentences and paragraphs, annotate; write out what
feels extraordinary, questionable, pleasant, or remarkable (and remark it out
loud in class).

### Student Attendance

> Students are expected to attend every session of their Core classes. Students
who miss class without instructor permission should expect to have their grade
lowered. Repeated unexcused absences will result in a failing grade or a
withdrawal from the class. In the event that a student must miss a class due
to religious observance, illness, or family emergency, instructors may
strongly encourage (though not require) that students complete additional
assignments to help make up for lost class participation. Whenever possible
(in the case of religious holidays, for example), students should provide
advance notification of absence.

### Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty

 Columbia College is dedicated to the highest ideals of integrity in academia.
Therefore, in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, any
instance of academic dishonesty, attempted or actual, will be reported to the
faculty chair of the course and to the dean of the Core Curriculum, who will
review the case with the expectation that a student guilty of academic
dishonesty will receive the grade of “F” in the course and be referred to
dean’s discipline for further institutional action.
