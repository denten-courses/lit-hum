## A. Synthesis

### Literacy Rate and Economy

By the time Mary Shelley completed her historic novel Frankenstein in 1817, the industrial revolution was fully under way. It was in this environment of rapid technological and economic development that not only the novel itself was forged, full of anxiety about man’s relationship with scientific progress, but its reception as well.  At the beginning of the 19th century, wages were rising and a burgeoning middle class was emerging. The reading culture and social context surrounding Frankenstein is one that would not look terribly unfamiliar to a modern observer.

However, there was still a long way to go before contemporary novels would become a product that everyone could enjoy. 500 copies of the first edition of Shelley’s novel were sold by the printer Lackington & Co at ten shillings and six pence apiece<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> – several days wages for an average laborer at the time<sup>[2](#footnote1)</sup>, making a book like Frankenstein a luxury to which most of the working class would not have had access. In addition, even by 1820 literacy rates in Great Britain were only 53%, with men tending to be more likely and women less likely to be literate<sup>[3](#footnote1)</sup>. In this sense, literacy still has not fully detached itself from conventional power structures, with wealthy men reading the most and poor women reading the least.

In fact, it was not the printed version of Shelley’s book that made her famous, but an 1823 theatrical adaptation by Richard Peake. It was this much more accessible format that truly put her on the map. “But lo and behold! I found myself famous,” Shelley wrote in a letter, “Frankenstein had prodigious success as a drama, and was about to be repeated, for the twenty-third night, at the English Opera House.” As a result of the success of the play, Shelley’s father, the political philosopher William Godwin, decided to have a new edition of the book published<sup>[4](#footnote1)</sup>.

### Reception and Practices of Reading

_Frankenstein_ was first published on January 1st 1818 in London. During this time period, popular writing genres were gothic, romanticism, drama and plays. This is also depicted in the novel. Henry Clerval, Victor Frankenstein’s best friend, was “deeply read in books of chivalry and romance (19). Additionally, “he [Henry Clerval] tried to make us [Frankenstein and his siblings] act plays…” (19). However, _Frankenstein_ can’t be characterized into any of these genres. While _Frankenstein_ has gothic elements in it including an emphasis on nature and horror, it does not fit into the gothic genre. Gothic revolves around sinister and evil plots, while _Frankenstein _focuses more on imagination and experimentation with technology.  Another uncommon aspect about _Frankenstein_ is that it is written by a female, something almost unheard of during this time period where the male literacy rate was 70 percent and the female literacy rate was only 55 percent. <sup>[2](#footnote1)</sup>

 Thus, _Frankenstein_ was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. The Bell’s Court and Fashionable Magazine in March of 1818 referred to it as a “very bold fiction” <sup>[3](#footnote1)</sup>  and The Gentleman’s Magazine in April 1818 called it “the production of no ordinary writer.” <sup>[4](#footnote1)</sup> People were shocked that a female wrote it and The London Literary Gazette wrote in November 1831 that _Frankenstein_ is “certainly one of the most original works that ever proceeded from a female pen.” <sup>[5](#footnote1)</sup> _Frankenstein_ is so original that it is even claimed to have formed it’s own genre. Brian Aldiss wrote in “Billion Year Spree” that _Frankenstein_ is the, “first seminal work to which the label science fiction can be logically attached.” <sup>[6](#footnote1)</sup> 

Nonetheless, while different, _Frankenstein_ was admired. The Blackwood Edinburg 2 Magazine wrote in March 1818, “Upon the whole, the work impresses us with a high idea of the author's original genius and happy power of expression.” <sup>[7](#footnote1)</sup>  And The Bell’s Court and Fashionable Magazine in March of 1818 wrote,” …its originality, excellence of language, and peculiar interest, is likely to be very popular.” <sup>[8](#footnote1)</sup>

During the eighteenth century cheap novels were becoming very popular, which helped lead to_ Frankenstein's_ success. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, novels were barely made in more than 1,000 or 1,500 copies. Yet, by the 1840s, 5,000 copies of novels was becoming more common. <sup>[9](#footnote1)</sup> This increase in reading is also seen in the novel as in the passage, “I [Victor Frankenstein] was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night”(2).  This fluctuation of printed novels allowed _Frankenstein_ to be more accessible to the public and grow in popularity. 

### Images of Reading in the Novel 

Reading and the absorption of knowledge is a theme throughout _Frankenstein _and can be categorized into three sections: Frankenstein’s childhood, Frankenstein at university and the monster watching the De Lacey family. These moments of reading and knowledge in the novel shed insight to reading practices and social context during the time period this novel was written. 

Frankenstein grew up curious and with a love for knowledge. Frankenstein was “passionately fond of reading. These were my study day and night” (2).  Frankenstein’s best friend, Henry Clerval, had this same thirst for knowledge and was often reading and writing. When Frankenstein went to University and Henry didn’t, Henry “deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education” (25). Both Henry and Frankenstein valued and were intrigued by learning. 

However, not everybody felt this way. Frankenstein’s family did not value education and Frankenstein’s father upon seeing Frankenstein reading a book on alchemy said “do not waste your time upon this, it is sad trash” (26). Without the support of his family, Frankenstein gained most of his knowledge by teaching it to himself. During the day, “I [Frankenstein] worked harder than the common sailors…..and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventure might derive the greatest practical advantage” (3). Frankenstein comments on the juxtaposition of his thirst for knowledge opposed to his peers apathy of knowledge when he says, "It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century, but while I followed the routine education of schools in Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favorite studies" (21). Frankenstein comments on that while he was curious and fascinated by learning, it was uncommon for the time.

 _Frankenstein_ focuses on Frankenstein’s pursuit of knowledge and comes to the conclusion that knowledge is destructive.  Frankenstein says, "Seek happiness in tranquility, and avoid ambition…” (162). In this passage, Frankenstein is advising Robert Walton to not pursue discoveries and new knowledge. It was through attending university, reading and learning that Frankenstein was able to create a monster which led to pain and misery. Perhaps the message of the novel is to warn people of the destructive forces that can be associated with learning and education.  As Frankenstein says, "Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow" (31).

"Lackington & Co.'s handwritten account of expenses for printing and publishing Frankenstein in January 1818 indicates that of the 500 copies printed, 459 (wi were given gratis to the author [6 copies], reviewers [16], copyright libraries [11], and booksellers who bought more than 25 copies [8]) were sold at 10/6 (ten shillings and six pence) per three volume set."

"The printing press already had a long history: it was invented in Germany by Joannes Gutenberg around 1440, and brought to England by William Caxton in the 1470s. Yet the basic technology of printing remained fundamentally the same up to the end of the 18th century, requiring two men to manually operate a wooden screw press, producing about 200 impressions an hour. The 19th century was the period in which this process was mechanised, automated, and made many times faster."

"Given this demographic situation alone a decline in literacy in the late eighteenth century would seem highly probable. To that factor must be added the social changes arising from early industrialization which militated strongly against full-time education"(Sanderson 78). 

"The effect of all these changes caused by the new industrialization was to make it even less likely than before that a child of the lower classes would be able to receive such an efficient full-time day education as to make it permanently literate. Given the conjunction of the demographic factors with these new social factors, it seems an inescapable conclusion that there was a decline in literacy during the later eighteenth century and the first and second decades of the nineteenth century" (Sanderson 80).

"In Britain, where literacy rates were higher, male literacy was about 70 per cent in 1850, and 55 per cent of females could read."

"First, from the late 1790s the wages of the handloom-weavers began to deteriorate. They thus had to work longer hours which removed the possibility of a child working for part of the day and attending school for the remainder" (Sanderson 78).

"In 1819 and the early 1820s many complaints are found that the poverty of weavers prevented them from sending their children to school"(Sanderson 78). 

"Needless to say, the last thing that these juvenile vagrants considered was going to school to get an education" (Sanderson 79)

"Futhermore, although endowed grammar schools increasingly taught reading and writing during the eighteenth century, yet they also increasingly charged fees which diminished their attractiveness to lower orders" (Sanderson 80).

"Instead, the dominant unit of production was the workshop, in which children and young persons were employed in number ranging from three or four up to 50, 60 or even 100" (Hopkins 55).

"By the 1830s the normal working day in Birmingham in the larger establishments was considered to be 12 hours, less two hours for meals, i.e. a ten hour day; though longer hours might be worked by children in domestic workshops" (Hopkins 55).


****What were the practices of reading?****

Lyons, M. (1999). New Readers in the Nineteenth Century. A History of Reading in the West, 340-342.

"The new public devoured cheap novels. In the eighteenth century, the novel was not regarded as a respectable art-form, but in the first quarter in the nineteenth century, its status was assured. It became the classic literary expression of triumphant bourgeois society. In the early years of the nineteenth century, novels were rarely produced in print runs of more than 1,000 or 1,500 copies. By the 1840s, edition of 5,000 copies were more common."

"The new readers of the nineteenth century were a source of profit, but they were also a source of anxiety and unease for social elites. The 1848 revolutions were partly blamed on the spread of subversive and socialist literature, which reached the urban worker and a new audience in the countryside. In 1858 the British novelist Wilkie Collins coined the phrase 'The Unknown Public' to describe the 'lost literary tribes' of 3 million lower-class readers, 'right out of the pale of literary civilization'."

"I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventure might derive the greatest practical advantage." (3)

"...I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country." (4)

"One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race." (11)

"You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did, and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been." (page 13)

"I was capable of more intense application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge." (18)

"He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of Kinda Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepuchlre from the hands of the infidels." (19)

"I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm." (20)

"I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself." (21)

"It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century, but while I followed the routine education of schools in Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favorite studies." (21)

"Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education." (25)

"I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge." (25)

"...but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha." (79)

"...but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardor for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone." (92)

""But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe.." (92)

"Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was." (93)

"Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates, I will proceed with my tale." (114)

"Seek happiness in tranquility, and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed." (162)
